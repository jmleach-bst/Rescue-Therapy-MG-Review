# `R` code to reproduce Figure 1

This `R` code reproduces the simulated data set used to produce Figure 1 of our manuscript *"Handling rescue therapy in Myasthenia Gravis clinical trials: why it matters and why you should care"* and additionally contains details on the mathematical models used to simulate the data set. Once the paper is published, we will provide the link. See file `figure1.Rmd` to run the code yourself or `figure1.html` for an easier viewing experience.
